Come check it out! ^^||7/22/06:|MMbot seems to have dodged the bullet yet again...|I'd like to thank all of the users that reported their findings to us. Based on the user feedback we've recieved over the last 12 hours, there isn't any confirmable evidence that can lead us to believe mmbot was directly responsible for a ban. Therefore, the detectability status indicator will be switched back to 'safe'. Please note that there isn't any scientific test we can do to know this with absolute certainty. Last nights ban wave was so widespread that its hard to know anything for sure. Please proceed with caution and as always, you use mmbot at your own risk.||7/22/06:|The long anticipated mass banning has come. There have been no confirmed cases of mmbot only bannings yet. Although with such a widespread ban of 30,000+ users, Its impossible to be sure of the scope of this ban. Therefore, I will be flagging the bot as detectable for the timebeing. Please proceed with caution and check back for more details. Absolutly do not use any hacks until this gets sorted.|~Smorg||7/11/06:|Theres a plethora of new and exciting test scripts available in the beta forums. Including scripts for: Meph/Andy; Boneash; Dac Farren; Threshsocket; & others.
